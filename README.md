# What I Learned:
1. ES Modules (ESM): I learned about the ES Module system in JavaScript, which allows for better organization and management of code by splitting it into smaller, reusable modules.
2. Import and Export Statements: The videos likely covered how to use import and export statements to share functionality between different modules in JavaScript, enabling a more modular approach to coding.

# What I Found Interesting:
1. Modular Code Organization: The concept of breaking down code into smaller, more manageable modules is intriguing. It's interesting to see how this approach can improve code readability, maintainability, and reusability.
2. ESM's Advantages: Exploring the benefits of using ES Modules over older module systems like CommonJS or AMD could be fascinating. Understanding the performance advantages and compatibility improvements with ES Modules would be valuable.

# What I Found Challenging:
1. Syntax and Usage: Depending on your familiarity with JavaScript, grasping the syntax and usage of import/export statements might be challenging initially. Understanding how to correctly structure and import/export modules to avoid errors could require some practice.
2. Integration with Existing Codebases: Implementing ES Modules in existing projects might pose challenges, especially if the project relies heavily on older module systems or lacks modular structure altogether. Migrating to ES Modules while ensuring backward compatibility could be a complex task.

# Importance of Commit Messages and Template Repo Tooling:
1. Commit Messages: Clear and descriptive commit messages are crucial for effective collaboration and version control. They provide context and history to changes made in the codebase, making it easier for team members to understand the development process.
2. Template Repo Tooling: Leveraging template repository tooling can streamline the setup and initialization of new projects, ensuring consistency in project structure, dependencies, and configuration. This can save time and prevent common setup errors.
